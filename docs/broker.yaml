    This is the API contract expected to be exposed by an overhide "broker".  This API is represented by the green "broker API" connector in the overhide component model:

    ![overhide component model](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/raw/master/docs/images/provided.png)

    Read this API with reference to the [glossary](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/glossary.md).

    ***
      A note on schemes used in the API.  
      
      Operations *GET*, *PUT*, *POST*, *DELETE* use the HTTPS scheme.  These endpoints should be understood as standard REST requests.  These configuration/discovery exchanges involve text parameters on the URL line and text/numeric payloads in the JSON representation.  They have URL encoded parameters on the URL line and use BASE64 encoding for some JSON attributes.  The BASE64 encoding is explicitly stated.

      Operations *WIRE* are WebSocket events that use a custom wire protocol.  The SSL secured WebSockets connection is to the same address as the HTTPS connection.  
    ***
      A note on the wire-protocol payload notation.  
      
      WSS event exchanged payloads are comprised of compact byte streams.  In the documentation payloads with compact byte streams are described as descriptors in the following format:

      | *syntax *    | *bytes* | *value* |
      | ---          | ---     | ---     |
      | foo          | 2       |         |
      | bar          | 1       | N       |
      | for i in N { |         |         |
      |   baz        | 4       |         |
      | }            |         | ``      |
              
      The above indicates that the first 3 bytes are followed by a loop of 4 byte words.  The number of iteration is specified by bits 16-23.

      All numeric values greater than a byte are sent in network order, big-endian format.  The *foo* above is 2-bytes wide, the first byte having the most significant bits.

      description: |
        Authenticate an invitee's user-address as a guest of a subscriber's user-address.

        An invitee into the system must provide a valid address on an [accepted remuneration provider](#operation--capabilities-remuneration-providers-get).  An invitee must prove ownership of said valid address.

        Transactions--on a supported remuneration-provider--from the *invitee-user-address* to the provided *inviter-user-address* are part of the state of the returned access token by this call.  The *inviter* may set [fee expectations](#definition-DatastoreKeySettings) on *segment-keys*.  If fees paid are expected, the *invitee* must necessairly have transacted with the *inviter*.

        The inviting subscriber must expose their *user-address* and a *shared-phrase* that's used to hash their *user-address*
        into an [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md).  The *shared-phrase* is equivalent to the
        *secret-phrase* passed into the [authenticate endpoint](#operation--auth-authenticate-put): except it's not kept secret by the 
        inviting user.  This is necessary to authorize the invitee to the inviting subscriber, and to ensure the inviting subscriber's 
        *user-address* does in fact hash to the desired indentity: we don't want to just pass the inviting subscriber's [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md),
        we want to calculate it.

        Returns an "invitee" token to be used for [token authentication](#security-definition-Authorization Header) in the rest of the API.

        The *invitee-user-address*  hashed by *invitee-secret-phrase* is the invitee's [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md)
        for the purposes of [write/publish permissions](#definition-DatastoreKeySettings) on *segment-keys*.

        If the *datastore-key*'s *allow-publish* setting is "self", the *identity* in the authentication token must match the *datastore-key* owner.

        If the *datastore-key*'s *allow-publish* setting is "signed", the author of the backchannel message is the *identity* tied ot the authorization token passed to this API.  Message author's public-key (hash) is present in the token and compared to the *allowed-publishers* list--if any--for this *datastore-key*.

        If the *datastore-key*'s *allow-publish* setting is "any", the *identity* in the authentication token must simply be valid: a valid broker system user is publishing.

        If the *shunt* query parameter is specified, full message content is sent via subscription.  Unless the *auto-acknowledge* flag is set, the messages do have to be explicitly [acknowledged](#operation-acknowledge-WIRE) to clear the backchannel queue.  Failure to acknowledge messages with *auto-acknowledge* off and [limit-bytes set](#definition-DatastoreKeySettings) may lead to a full backchannel queue and dropped messages; not forwarded to these live subscriptions.

        This call requires two identities:  the *segment-key* and [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md) from the path constitute the *datastore-key*.  The [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md) from the [authorization header](#security-definition-Authorization Header)
        is used to qualify the data stored at the *segment-key*: this [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md) is the delegate.

        For the *set* to succeed the *datastore-key* (segment-key @ identity) must exist and be owned by the [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md)
        from the path.

        A delegate can only write their value to this *segment-key* [settings on *segment-key* permitting](#definition-DatastoreKeySettings).  Only the delegate identified can write data.  The *settings* are solely to identify who the delegates can be.

        If transferring a *segment-key* with a public restricted identity (0 .. 9999), if the
        *segment-key* already exists at provided identity for a different *owner*, the message
        call fails with a 400 -- "datastore-key ownership conflict; segment-key @ identity already reserved".

        If the *type-key* requested is not supported by this broker system the message call fails with
        a 400 -- "invalid type-key, doesn't match broker system capabilities".

        If data from the remote *GUID* cannot be extracted or in otherwise unavailable the message call fails with a 
        400 -- "cannot reach data".

        If the payload from the other broker is malformated and cannot be imported the message call fails 
        with a 400 -- "cannot process input", followed by additional optional verbiage.
