    This is the API contract expected to be exposed by an overhide "broker".  This API is represented by the green "broker API" connector in the overhide component model:

    ![overhide component model](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/raw/master/docs/images/provided.png)

    To load this API into another [Swagger viewer/editor](https://editor.swagger.io) find [the GitHub *Swagger 2.0* definition file](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/broker.yaml) and import as YAML.

    Read this API with reference to the [glossary](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/glossary.md).

    ***
      A note on schemes used in the API.  All operations unless explicitly indicated use the HTTPS scheme.  The [backchannel-message/../subscribe/.. operation](#operation--backchannel-message-subscribe--segment-key--get) uses the WSS scheme.

      * authenticate providing an [access token](#security-definition-Authorization Header): authenticate subscribers of 
        the system and invitees of subscribers of the system.
      * work with  authority levels.
      * change *identity* credentials.  Setting *identity* for the first time is
      done with the [authenticate endpoint](#path--auth-authenticate).
      * work with subscription details for a supported remuneration API and a
      given *identity*.

        into an [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md).  The *shared-phrase* is equivalent to the
        *secret-phrase* passed into the [authenticate endpoint](#operation--auth-authenticate-put): except it's not kept secret by the 
        inviting user.  This is necessary to authorize the invitee to the inviting subscriber, and to ensure the inviting subscriber's 
        *user-address* does in fact hash to the desired indentity: we don't want to just pass the inviting subscriber's [identity](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md),

        If the *datastore-key*'s *allow-publish* setting is "any", the *identity* in the authentication token must simply be valid: a valid broker system user is publishing.

        If the *type-key* requested is not supported by this broker system the message call fails with
        a 400 -- "invalid type-key, doesn't match broker system capabilities".

        If data from the remote *GUID* cannot be extracted or in otherwise unavailable the message call fails with a 
        400 -- "cannot reach data".

        If the payload from the other broker is malformated and cannot be imported the message call fails

      The *identity* is valid, authenticated, with proper authorizations, but:

      1. the *identity* has no write or publish access to the valid *datastore-key*.
      1. the API request would exceed rates and limits as set out within the authorities at the current subscription plan.

      Errors equally apply to "inviee" *identities*.

      Results in one or more of the following error message strings.

      The message enum might be extended by broker system.

      Broker systems might not throw up this response when read and write rates are exceeded.  Instead a broker system might start throttling responses or responding at a lower-priority.

securityDefinitions:
  Authorization Header:
    type: apiKey

    name: Authorization
    description: |
      Provides an authentication token as retrieved with either the [authentication endpoint](#path--auth-authenticate)
      or the [invitee bouncer endpoint](#path--auth-bounce).

      The token returned by either call must be provided in an "Authorization" header to API calls secured with this security definition.

      The tokens are whitelisted by the *overhide* broker until revoked or expired (at broker's purview).  
      
      The token contains the *identity*--hashed in implementation specific ways--to help with access control for the rest of the API.  
      
      Details in the [*identity write-up*](https://github.com/JakubNer/overhide/blob/master/docs/identity.md#authenticated-sessions).
  Authorization Query:

    name: auth

      Same as the Authorization Header security scheme except token is passed in a query parameter named *auth*.
